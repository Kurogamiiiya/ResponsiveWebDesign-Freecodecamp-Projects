          <ul>
            <li>
              Soekarno was born to Raden Soekemi Sosrodihardjo and Ida Ayu
              Nyoman Rai on June 6 1901. His father was a teacher at a Javanese
              elementary school and his mother was the daughter of a Balinese
              noble family. Soekarno was the third of four children. As a child,
              Soekarno lived with his grandfather, Raden Hardjokromo in
              Tulungagung, East Java.
            </li>
            <li>
              Next, Soekarno entered elementary school at Eerste Inlandse School
              in Mojokerto and in 1911, Soekarno moved to Europeesche Lagere
              School. After completing basic education, Soekarno continued his
              education at HBS (Hogere Burger School) in Surabaya.
            </li>
            <li>
              Soekarno lived with H.O.S Cokroaminoto, the leader of the Syarekat
              Islam (SI) movement organization. He then continued his education
              majoring in civil engineering at THS (Technische Hoogeschool)
              Bandung in 1921 and obtained a civil engineer (Ir.) degree in

          <ul>
            <li>
              Soekarno became active in the world of politics since living in
              Surabaya. His thinking was influenced by H.O.S Cokroaminoto and
              his comrades in arms such as Alimin, Musso, Darsono, Haji Agus
              Salim and Abdul Muis. The young Soekarno was also active in the
              Tri Koro Dharmo organization and wrote articles in the daily
              Oetoesan Indies.
            </li>
            <li>
              During his education at THS, the Algemene Study Club was founded
              in 1926, which later became the forerunner of PNI. In 1929,
              because of his political activities, Soekarno was arrested and
              exiled to Ende, Flores, because he was considered involved in the
              nationalist movement which was considered to be destroying
              colonial order. During his exile, Soekarno wrote many essays and
              speeches that inspired the Indonesian independence movement.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1930, Sukarno was transferred to Sukamiskin prison. Soekarno
              was freed from prison after reading his plea entitled Indonesia
              Sues before the Dutch East Indies government, PNI members and the
              general public.

            <li>
              Sukarno was released from detention in 1942. At first, Sukarno
              supported the arrival of Japan. The policy of establishing
              organizations such as Jawa Hokokai, Center for People's Power
              (Putera), BPUPKI and PPKI became Japan's influence in inviting
              nationalists to join.

            <li>
              At the time of independence, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta proclaimed
              independence as a form of Indonesia's release from the shackles of
              colonialism. He was appointed as Indonesia's first president and
              led Indonesia until 1967. During his reign, Soekarno fought for
              Indonesia's independence and sovereignty.

          <ul>
            <li>
              During his tenure as president, Soekarno had many achievements in
              the international world. Some of the successes achieved were the
              success of the Asia-Africa Conference (KAA), the formation of the
              Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and diplomatic relations with large
              countries such as the Soviet Union and China.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the period from 1963 to 1966, Sukarno sparked tensions with
              Malaysia by arguing that he did not agree to the merger of the
              Malayan Federation which consisted of Malaysia, Singapore and the
              British Empire's colonies.

            <li>
              In 1965 the G30S incident occurred which was the beginning of the
              decline of Sukarno's leadership. As a result of the G30S,
              Indonesia's condition was unstable, which required Soekarno to act
              by issuing the Sebelas Maret (Supersemar) order. It was from this
              letter that the leadership mandate moved to Suharto until
              officially in 1967 President Sukarno was replaced by Suharto. He
              died on June 21 1970 in Jakarta and was buried in Blitar, East
              Java.
